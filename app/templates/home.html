<h1>Property Appraisal System </h1>
<p class="lead">This system was built, so users can find the value of their property in a fast and efficient way. <br>
<br>
This program aims to benefit people who would like to request appraisals for their property, but would like to see what the factors affecting their final property value are, 
as well as the impact of each of those factors on the price of the property.</p>
